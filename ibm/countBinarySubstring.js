// A binary string is a string consisting only of 0s and 1s. A substring is a contiguous group of characters within
// a string.
// Given a binary string, find the number of substrings that contain an equal number of 0s and 1s and all
// the 0s and 1s are grouped together. Note that duplicate substrings are also counted in the answer.
// For example, '0011' has two overlapping substrings that meet the criteria: '0011' and '01'.

//  Let s = "011001"
//  The substrings "01", "10", "1100", and "01" have equal numbers of 0s and 1s with all 0s and 1s grouped
//  consecutively. Hence the answer is 4 .
//  Note that the substring "0110" has equal numbers of 0s and 1s but is not counted because not all 0s and 1s
//  are grouped together.
